*This README is copied and slightly adapted from the documentation's user guide
(see "Building documentation"). The steps below are only available here for convenience.
Please refer to the documentation for further instructions, as well as the full user guide
and the developer guide.*


# Installing the backend dependencies

SMARTSexplore requires Python 3.8 or later. After you've installed an
appropriate Python version, please create a new virtual environment,
then activate it:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now, install the project and its dependencies:

```
python setup.py install
```


# Installing the frontend dependencies

For generating the frontend code, you need a working `npm` installation.
We recommend using
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) to install
an isolated version of npm.

After doing so, install all dependencies via:

```
npm install
```

Then, build the frontend code:

```
npm run build
```


# Building documentation

After following the steps to install the backend and frontend dependencies, you can generate
browsable HTML documentation by first installing the jsdoc package:

```
npm install -g jsdoc
```

Then building the documentation:

```
python setup.py build_sphinx
```

and opening the file `build/sphinx/html/index.html`. It includes a user guide, a developer guide,
and documentation for the backend and frontend APIs.



# Running a SMARTSexplore instance

## Installing required external programs

Please refer to https://software.zbh.uni-hamburg.de for retrieving
the required programs listed below.

For making molecule uploads work in the frontend, please place
licensed versions of the following NAOMI programs into the `bin/`
folder:

* `mol2svg`
* `SMARTSMoleculeMatcher` (formerly known as `structure_preprocessor`)

If you wish to add your own SMARTS data, it's required you also place
the following NAOMI programs there:

* `SMARTScompare`
* `SMARTScompareViewer`


## Generating the backend data

To initialize the database, run

```
flask db init
```

Then, add all SMARTS libraries from the data folder:

```
flask smarts add_libraries data/*.smarts
```

Now, SMARTS-SMARTS subset edges need to be calculated and stored in the database:

```
flask smarts calculate_edges SubsetOfFirst
```

After doing so, let the software draw all SMARTS and SMARTS-SMARTS edges:

```
flask smarts draw_all_smarts
flask smarts draw_all_subsets
```

The backend data is now ready.


## Starting the server

After following the steps above, you can start the server via

```bash
flask run
```

and access the SMARTSexplore application at <http://localhost:5000>.
